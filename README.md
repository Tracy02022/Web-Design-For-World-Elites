# Web-Design-For-World-Elites
A coding exercise for World Elites

I use JavaScript, CSS, HTML and a little knowledge of JSON to write the fronend website.
However, I am a beginer for this design, I didn't solve the sharing objects between HTMLs. Therefore, when click "price" or "popularity" button, there will be a logic problem. You can only see the range among current page. I will solve it later.
