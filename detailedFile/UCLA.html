        <p> UCLA is a public research university located in Davis, California, just west of Sacramento.
            While UC Davis' agricultural heritage remains strong, the university has expanded over the past century to include graduate and professional programs in medicine.
            UC Davis' School of Veterinary Medicine is the largest in the United States and is ranked second in the nation.</p>
